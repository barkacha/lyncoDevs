1.0.0.2

I didn't set Assembly Info. I am working 3rd party InstallShield for creating setup.
I have set version and all in it but didn't set in Assembly. 
I thought InstallShield will manage. Anyways, I have changed Assembly info.
It is working fine now. Let me know if I still understand wrong.
